## Existing reserved names

These names are labeled as both *reserved and existing* (by the [new organization page](https://github.com/organizations/new)).

These names have **not** been included in the `reserved-names.json` file because the pages appear as a typical user/organization page.

* https://github.com/bookmarks
* https://github.com/media
* https://github.com/owners
* https://github.com/page
* https://github.com/tasks
* https://github.com/uploads

## Reserved, but page redirects

These names are labeled as *reserved* but you *should not* see them in the address bar because the page automatically redirects.

## Private Feed

Clicking on the "subscript to your news feed" at the bottom of the main https://github.com page takes you to news feed page with a url similar to this: `https://github.com/{user}.private.atom?token=Base_16_encoded_value==`.

This list doesn't account for these pages as the "Username may only contain alphanumeric characters or single hyphens, and cannot begin or end with a hyphen".
